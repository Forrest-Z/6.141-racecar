To start:
 - roslaunch obstacle localize.launch
    start the localization node, it will get a map as soon as a map server is
    launched
 - roslaunch obstacle base_server.launch
    this will create a map server that serves the empty base map to the
    localizer
- roslaunch obstacle simulate.launch
    this starts the simulation and overrides the empty map server with an
    obstacle filled map server, so that the laser scans will show obstacles
    that the localizer is unaware of

in real life we would have to change the line in the simulate file that
launches the test obstacle map to load the empty map instead
